# Yoga CoPilot (MVP)

## Project Description

Yoga CoPilot (MVP) is a web application designed to provide yoga instructors and self-practitioners with quick, personalized "mini-yoga practices" generated by artificial intelligence. The MVP aims to create a tool that, based on basic user input parameters (duration, level), generates complete, well-thought-out asana sequences lasting up to 30 minutes. The application aims to save users time and provide targeted inspiration for practice.

This MVP utilizes Supabase for authentication, backend functions (Edge Functions), and the database, along with an external language model (LLM) for sequence generation. The user interface is built using Astro, React, and Tailwind CSS.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**
  - Astro 5 (Minimal JavaScript, fast performance)
  - React 19 (Interactive components)
  - TypeScript 5 (Static typing)
  - Tailwind 4 (Styling)
  - Shadcn/ui (Accessible React components)
- **Backend:**
  - Supabase (PostgreSQL database, BaaS SDK, Authentication)
- **AI:**
  - Openrouter.ai (Access to various LLMs like Claude 3.x, Gemini Pro, GPT-4o)
- **CI/CD & Hosting:**
  - GitHub Actions (CI/CD pipelines)
  - DigitalOcean (Docker image hosting)
- **Node.js Version:** 22.14.0 (specified in `.nvmrc`)

## Getting Started Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Moviss/yoga-copilot.git
    cd yoga-copilot
    ```
2.  **Install Node.js:**
    Ensure you have Node.js version **22.14.0** installed. We recommend using a version manager like nvm:
    ```bash
    nvm install 22.14.0
    nvm use 22.14.0
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables (e.g., Supabase keys, Openrouter API key). Refer to `.env.example` if available (Note: currently no example file mentioned, need to create one).
5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application should now be running locally, typically at `http://localhost:4321`.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
- `npm run preview`: Previews the production build locally.
- `npm run astro`: Accesses the Astro CLI.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase using ESLint.
- `npm run lint:fix`: Lints the codebase and automatically fixes issues.
- `npm run format`: Formats the code using Prettier.

## Project Scope (MVP)

- User authentication (Email/Password via Supabase Auth).
- Input form for sequence parameters (duration, focus, level).
- AI-powered sequence generation using an external LLM via Supabase Edge Function.
  - Utilizes a predefined list of asanas.
  - Applies basic safety and sequencing logic.
  - Returns results in a structured format (JSON preferred).
- Display of the generated sequence (text list with asana names and transition suggestions).
- Display of illustrations for each asana from a pre-generated library.
- Feedback mechanism (Accept/Reject buttons, optional comment field).
- User guide/disclaimer modal.
- Basic error handling for technical issues and low-quality generation.

## Project Status

- **Current Stage:** Development (MVP)
- **Target:** Verify the need for an AI tool generating short, personalized yoga sequences and assess the quality of generated sequences.
- **Success Metrics:**
  - Functional web app launch.
  - Sequence acceptance rate > 75% in test group.
  - Positive qualitative feedback from testers.
  - Operational costs < $100/month.
